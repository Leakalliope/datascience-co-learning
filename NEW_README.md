## Python

* [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/) from OTS: Perfect for anyone with limited exposure to programming. Covers everything you need to get started with Python. Available in English,German, Spanish, Russian, Korean, and Romanian.

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): Teaches Python as a means to get things done. Free if you use the website, also available as a [book](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff) and a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=FOR_LIKE_10_BUCKS).
