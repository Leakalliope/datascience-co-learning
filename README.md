<br><br>
## Python

* [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/) from OTS: Perfect for anyone with limited exposure to programming. Covers everything you need to get started with Python. Available in English, German, Spanish, Russian, Korean, and Romanian.

* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/): Teaches Python as a means to get things done. Free if you use the website, also available as a [book](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff) and a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=FOR_LIKE_10_BUCKS).

* [Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_course.php) from Bernd Klein: Probably one of the most comprehensive free tutorials available, it covers everything from "Hello World" to advanced OOP. Klein also offers quite a bit beyond the core material, e.g. _Advanced Topics_, _Numerical Python_, _Machine Learning_, and _Tkinter Tutorial_. All the material is offered in English and German.

* [Introduction to Data Processing with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/) from OTS: A work in progress, our own tutorial builds on the foundations of [Introduction to Programming with Python](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/). You'll learn how to install and use Jupyter notebooks, load data, analyze a survey, and visualize your data. We've got quite a bit in the pipeline, so be sure to check back soon.

* [Pandas Tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas) from Hernand Rojas: This tutorial consists of a series of Jupyter Notebooks introducing the fundamentals of the Pandas module. The notebooks can be freely downloaded. The Pandas tutorial, as well as tutorials on a number of other data science related topics, are also available as [email courses](http://www.hedaro.com/).

* [StatsModels Tutorial](https://github.com/jseabold/tutorial): Repo of Jupyter Notebooks dealing with the [StatsModels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) module. The material is a little old and not very well organized, but there are still a few gems there for anyone doing statistics in Python.

* [SciPy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/): A brief (1-2 hours per module) introduction to the tools and techniques of Python's [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) module.




<br><br>
## R

* [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) from DataCamp: A solid, 6-part intro to the basics of the R language with 4-5 hours of material. If you're interested in continuing with DataCamp you can purchase a subscription for 22â‚¬ per month, which gives you access to 137 courses (R and Python) and a number of career and skill tracks.

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) from Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham: An excellent introduction to data science via R by two heavyweights of the R community, it is broken down into 5 parts, corresponding to steps in the data science process: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, and Communicate. You'll learn the "tidy" approach to data, and immediately use libraries such as `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`. Some basic knowledge of R can be helpful, but isn't absolutely necessary (DataCamp's intro is more than enough). It's also available as a book.

* [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) from Hadley Wickham: A companion website to the book of the same name, it introduces more advanced features (and quirks) of the R language, e.g. style, exception handling, functional programming, R's C interface, etc.

* [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) from Johns Hopkins University + Coursera:
